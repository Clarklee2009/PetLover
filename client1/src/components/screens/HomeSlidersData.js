I spent eight hours photographing these birds and this was the image I made, when the sun was setting. My camera was set on an icebox, to get a low-angle perspective and the sun reflecting off of the water.",

        "It was a quiet morning at Nagarahole Tiger Reserve. The sun was opening up and the mist from the night was clearing. As we made a drive through the woods, we saw this beautiful leopardess perching on her favorite tree. Ever since I started wildlife photography, I wanted to photograph a leopard on a tree. It took over three years to find my photo. I love everything about this picture—a prowling leopardess, a beautiful tree with white flowers, soft sunlight—it was just a perfect setting, like a dream.",

        "First day of early morning whale watching sponsored by Ralph Lee Hopkins and the Whale Trust off the north west coast of Maui. We were in a large zodiac type boat with inflatable sides and twin 250 HP outboard motors that allowed us to quickly move about. It is an understatement that whale activity was incredible! This is one of many close sightings and breaches and we were fortunate to capture and witness the sounds and activity. An epic morning.",

        "A group of emperor penguin chicks huddled together. As they get older, both parents need to leave the chick to find enough food. When the parents are out at sea, the chicks huddle together to keep one another warm. In this case they are also hiding behind a block of ice to keep the high winds off them. If anything happens to either parent before the chick fledges, they will not make it.",

We wandered the tracks and late in the day noticed a large group of African elephants with babies on the move; presumably in search of new foraging areas. The hot and dusty conditions at sunset simply added to an unimaginable and unforgettable mood and atmosphere!",

This beautiful female was sitting quite calmly in the midst of the Sepilok Forest Reserve. Staring through a long zoom lens, I couldn't help but admire how emotive these wonderful distant cousins are, while also feeling sorry for how much of their environment we have taken away.",

Lucky for me, a young southern fur seal decided to chase a group of gentoos right towards our Zodiac. It even has its mouth wide open, to add to the drama. Right place right time for this shot. :)",

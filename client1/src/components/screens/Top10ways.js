          everyone. Get together with classmates to adopt an animal from a
          wildlife conservation organization such as the World Wildlife Fund.
          Symbolic adoptions help fund organizations.

          5. Speak Up. Share your passion for wildlife conservation with your
          family. Tell your friends how they can help. Ask everyone you know to
          pledge to do what they can to stop wildlife trafficking.
        </h2>

        <h2>
          6. Buy Responsibly. By not purchasing products made from endangered
          animals or their parts, you can stop wildlife trafficking from being a
          profitable enterprise.
        </h2>
        <h2>
          7. Trash isn’t just ugly, it’s harmful. Birds and other animals can
          trap their heads in plastic rings. Fish can get stuck in nets. Plus,
          trash pollutes everyone’s natural resources. Do your part by putting
          trash in its place.
        </h2>
        <h2>
          8. Recycle. Find new ways to use things you already own. If you can’t
          reuse, recycle. The Minnesota Zoo encourages patrons to recycle mobile
          phones to reduce demand for the mineral coltan, which is mined from
          lowland gorillas’ habitats.
        </h2>
        <h2>
          9. Restore. Habitat destruction is the main threat to 85 percent of
          all threatened and endangered species, according to the International
          Union for Conservation of Nature. You can help reduce this threat by
          planting native trees, restoring wetlands or cleaning up beaches in
          your area.
        </h2>
        <h2>
          10. Join. Whether you’re into protecting natural habitats or
          preventing wildlife trafficking, find the organization that speaks to
          your passion and get involved. Become a member. Stay informed.
          Actively support the organization of your choice.
